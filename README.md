# Reliable_UDP_Server

A reliable UDP server built in python 3 for the Csc 361 (Computer Communication and Networks) course at UVIC. 

It can simulate the packets being lost on the network using a random number generator function and can retransmit them for error recovery. It also checks the final file by using the md5 sum.
